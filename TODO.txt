**Priority**
* Config GUI NOW!!!
  * NEED this 1st and foremost
* Add in VisualHelpers checkbox to GUI

* Look into adding another bit.band check to filter out corpses.
  * That would mean testing if dead NPC's ObjectTypes return Unit and Corpse
* Use NOCARRIER's combat log UnitsAroundUnit to build a non FH/OS cache manager
* Add health potion to defensives


**Suggestions**
* Svs
  * Add Aspect of the Cheetah toggles for ooc and ic
  * Toggles for the use of Mult-Shot on mouseover logic
