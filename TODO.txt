** BUGS **
* Countershot needs a cooldown check, unfortunately
* Redesign Aspect Config
  * If checked, Aspect alwasy on. Turns off if in combat and not glyphed for it.

** DESIGN GOALS **

* Allow for drop in replacements
  * ObjectManager code all in its own file
  * Global code in one file
  * Class code in one file
  * NO GLOBALS if we can help it


* Test
  * If my Firehack Overrides interfere with other AddOns even if RotAgent isn't the active profile.
  *
